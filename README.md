# Prisma Cloud IaC Scan Action

# This project has been deprecated in favor of newer capabilities documented here: https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov-action

## Description

A GitHub Action checks for security issues using the Prisma Cloud Infrastructure as Code Scan on the IaC files present in the repository. This action can give you results as an issue, pull request comment and pull request check, or can be viewed as pipeline annotations.

## Setup

#### Step 1: Acquire Prisma Cloud API credentials

To run the scan, the action needs a Prisma Cloud Access Key and Secret Key.

If you do not have a key, refer to [Create and Manage Access Keys](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-access-keys.html) to acquire one.

#### Step 2: Create GitHub secrets from the API credentials

Create GitHub Secrets called `PRISMA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY` and `PRISMA_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY` for the Access Key and Secret Key respectively with the values acquired in Step 1.

Refer to [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) for more details on how to setup secrets.

#### Step 3: Configure Workflow

Configure your workflow based on the following example.

Note: the `actions/checkout` step is required to run before the scan action, otherwise the action does not have access to the IaC files to be scanned.

```yaml
name: Prisma Cloud IaC Scan Example
on: [ pull_request ]

jobs:
  prisma_cloud_iac_scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Run Prisma Cloud IaC Scan to check 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run Scan on IaC files in the repository
        uses: prisma-cloud-shiftleft/iac-scan-action@v1
        id: iac-scan
        with:
          prisma_api_url: 'https://api.prismacloud.io'
          access_key: ${{ secrets.PRISMA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY }}
          secret_key: ${{ secrets.PRISMA_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY }}
          asset_name: 'my-asset-name'
          template_type: 'TF'
          template_version: '0.13'
      - name: Upload scan result artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
        if: success() || failure()
        with:
          name: iac_scan_result
          path: ${{ steps.iac-scan.outputs.iac_scan_result_path }}
```

## Configuration Options

#### Scan options

| Config Key                                                             | Description |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| prisma_api_url<br />*Required*                                         | The URL for Prisma Cloud varies depending on the region and cluster on which your tenant is deployed.<br />If your tenant is, for example, https://app2.prismacloud.io or https://app.eu.prismacloud.io then replace **app** in the URL with **api** and enter it here. Refer to the [Prisma Cloud REST API Reference](https://api.docs.prismacloud.io/reference#try-the-apis) for more details. |
| access_key<br />*Required*                                             | Refer to [Create and Manage Access Keys](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/manage-prisma-cloud-administrators/create-access-keys.html) to acquire Acccess and Secret keys.<br />We recommend the actual value to be stored as a GitHub Secret and used here in the Action with `${{ secrets.PRISMA_CLOUD_ACCESS_KEY }}` |
| secret_key<br />*Required*                                             | The secret key is provided to you at the time of Access Key generation.<br />You cannot acquire it post generation.<br />We recommend the actual value to be stored as a GitHub Secret and used here in the Action with `${{ secrets.PRISMA_CLOUD_SECRET_KEY }}` |
| asset_name<br />*Required*                                             | Can be a project name or any identifier you want to attach to the scan.<br />Some examples are a CI/CD project name or a Git repository name.<br />Eg: `my-repo-name` |
| template_type<br />*Required*                                          | Specify the template type.<br />Valid values are as follows:<br />`TF` for Terraform<br />`CFT` for AWS CloudFormation<br />`K8S` for Kubernetes |
| template_version                                                       | Specify the template version.<br />Valid values are: `0.11`, `0.12` and `0.13`<br />Note: Only used for 'TF' templateType. |
| tags                                                                   | Prisma Cloud tags are different from cloud tags that you might have included in your IaC templates.<br />Prisma Cloud tags will facilitate use of upcoming Prisma Cloud features like role-based access control and policy selection.<br />Eg: `owner:johndoe,team:creditapp,env:dev` |
| failure_criteria<br />Default: `High:1,Medium:1,Low:1,Operator:or`   | Enables you to evaluate scan results against set failure criteria to obtain failed or passed verdicts. You can set the count for high, medium, and low severity issues and use `and`/`or` operators to refine your criteria.<br />The IaC scan API checks each severity violation number separately against scan results and applies the operator to each evaluation.<br />The scan triggers a failure if the number of violations is greater than or equal to the failureCriteria values.<br />The Pipeline will be set the Failed if the failure criteria matches. |
| scan_path<br />Default: `./`                                         | Path of the directory containing the IaC files.<br />The path is relative to the repository root. |
| use_scan_path_when_pr<br />Default: `false`                          | Specifies if files in scan_path should be scanned in context of a PR, not only changed files.  Otherwise, only files changed in context of PR are scanned, which includes files outside of scan_path and excludes unchanged files in scan_path.  Default is false. |
| upload_scan_path_only<br />Default: `false`                          | Specifies if only files in scan_path should be uploaded to be scanned.  By default the entire GitHub workspace directory is zipped and uploaded.  This option may be necessary if there are other files in the workspace directory besides IaC template files.  Too many files may cause the  action to timeout.  Default is false. |
| variables                                                              | Template variables in comma separate key:value pairs.<br />Eg: `k1:v1,k2:v2` |
| variable_files                                                         | Comma separated list of variable file paths.<br />Paths are relative to the repository root.<br />Eg: `./var1.json,./var2.json` |
| create_issue<br />Default: `false`                                   | If turned on an Issue will be created with the scan report.<br />Note: Only created on scan failure. |
| create_pull_request_check<br />Default: `false`                      | If turned on a Check on Pull Request will be created with the scan report. |
| create_pull_request_comment<br />Default: `false`                    | If turned on a Comment on the Pull Request will be created with the scan report. |
| github_token<br />Default: `${{ github.token }}`<br />Required if any of the above `create*` are turned on | The GitHub Token.<br />You can choose to use a different token than the pipeline default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.<br />Eg: `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |
| result_path<br />Default: `./prismacloud_iac`                        | Path for the directory where result files should be written |
| ignore_ssl<br />Default: `false`                                     | Should internal API client ignore SSL errors.<br />Useful when using on GitHub Enterprise On-Prem. |

| iac_scan_result_md_path         | Path for the detailed result Markdown file  |

##### Files written to workspace

All paths are relative the workspace root. The base path `./prismacloud_iac` is configurable via the `result_path` option.

| File                           | Description                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |

| ./prismacloud_iac/result.md    | Scan report in Markdown format  |
| ./prismacloud_iac/result.sarif | Scan report in SARIF Log format |

#### SARIF upload

When a scan finds issues the action will always write the report in SARIF Log format in the workspace.
